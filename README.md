# IFT1005-shop-online

Throughout the IFT1005 course at Université de Montréal, our team developed an online shop using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JQuery). The project aimed to provide users with an enjoyable and seamless shopping experience. It was designed with a clean and modern look, which was optimized for various screen sizes.

The website allows users to browse products and add items to their cart for purchase using product filters. It also features simple animations. Our team worked collaboratively to ensure that the site was intuitive and easy to navigate.
