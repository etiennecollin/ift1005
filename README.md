# ift1005-shop-online

During the IFT1005 course at Université de Montréal, we developed an online shop using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JQuery). Our project aimed to provide users with an enjoyable and seamless shopping experience. We designed the site with a clean and modern look, which was optimized for various screen sizes.

The site allowed users to browse products and add items to their cart for purchase. We used JQuery to enhance the user experience, such as implementing product filters and adding animations to the shopping cart. Our team worked collaboratively to ensure that the site was intuitive and easy to navigate.

Overall, our project demonstrated our proficiency in front-end web development and user interface design. We are proud of the final product and the skills we gained throughout the development process.
